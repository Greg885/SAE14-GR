            <p>Having started with soccer like most young boys, I found my path in handball when I was 10 years old. Encouraged by my parents to resume sports after a long-term injury, I began practicing this sport at the Handball Club de Village-Neuf (HCVN), where I took my first steps in a team at the departmental level. The following year, despite a move to a higher division, the atmosphere didn't seem optimal to me. So, I made the decision to join another club. It was TV Klein-Basel in Switzerland that welcomed me and allowed me to acquire new skills, both in sports and linguistics. Playing in a Pre-national championship, we traveled across the country, covering thousands of kilometers by train. The atmosphere, coaches, and team spirit allowed me to flourish fully for 2 seasons. In 2021, as several players decided to leave the team to focus on their studies, I chose to cross the border again and confirmed my transfer to HCVNâ€”a return to my roots on my homeland to complete my cycle with the U18. I had the chance to play in a highly competitive inter-departmental category, exploring Alsace from end to end every weekend. After celebrating my 18th birthday in May 2023, I am currently playing in the senior team of the club at the regional level. As the youngest player on the team, I am slowly finding my footing in more intense and rough matches, always supported and encouraged by teammates and numerous supporters making their voices heard in the stands.</p>
